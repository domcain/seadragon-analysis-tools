# Welcome to SeadragonSearch Analytics Repository
Students undertaking their cap-stone computer science, data science and software engineering unit, [Professional Computing](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=cits3200) at the University of Western Australia, during semester 2 of 2022. [Dominic Cain](https://github.com/domcain), [Hannah Doret](https://github.com/hannahdoret), [Nathan Eden](https://github.com/NEDEN249), [Rachel Nguyen](https://github.com/nhmn1601) and [Aidan Smith](https://github.com/SuperAiderton) were responsible for the creation of this project.

# The purpose of this project
To help the SeadragonSearch team manage, and improve data input and quality to SeadragonSearch database.

This project is a data manipulation tool for cross-checking photo uploads. SeadragonSearch relies on imagery sourced from communities who photograph seadragons, including SCUBA divers, snorkelers, and beach or aquarium visitors. Some photographers who join the SeadragonSearch project have already uploaded their seadragon imagery to another citizen science data collection platform, such as iNaturalist. In these cases, the photographers often upload some images directly to the SeadragonSearch database, then give the SeadragonSearch team permission to source further imagery from their iNaturalist accounts. This can create confusion about which images have already been uploaded directly to SeadragonSearch and may cause duplicate entries in the system.

The SeadragonSearch team would like to develop a tool to cross-check data from SeadragonSearch with data from iNaturalist, in order to clarify which images are present in each database and avoid duplicate uploads to SeadragonSearch. the SeadragonSearch team can manually export CSV data spreadsheets from each platform listing information such as dates and locations of individual photos already uploaded, categorized by photographer. Using this provided spreadsheet data, the tool the SeadragonSearch team are seeking would then help them to compare what an individual photographer has uploaded to iNaturalist with what they have uploaded to SeadragonSearch, allowing the SeadragonSearch team to identify duplicates, and/or generate a list of encounters that still need to be downloaded from iNaturalist and uploaded to SeadragonSearch.
