SDS Analytics.py \u00b6 SDS Analytics.py acts as the main.py seen in a variety of other projects. This file creates the user interface and is responsible for all its functionality. data_analysis.py \u00b6 data_analysis.py handles all under the hood operations to produce an Excel workbook from input filepaths, by comparing the contents of the input files. The only function in data_analysis.py that should be called from another file is called analyse_data_files. This function takes two arguments: the first is the filepath of a Seadragon Search file (string), and the second is a list of the filepaths of iNaturalist files (a list of strings). If the function encounters an error, it returns a list of the form [False, error_message] (where error_message is a string). If the function executes successfully, it returns a list of the form [True, preview, suggested_filename, new_wb] (where preview is a string, suggested_filename is a string, and new_wb is a Workbook, which is a type from the module xlwt).","title":"For the Developer"},{"location":"for-the-developer/#running-the-code-in-the-development-environment","text":"Clone the repository to your personal computer by running: 1 $ git clone https://github.com/domcain/seadragon-analysis-tools.git in your terminal.
