# Welcome to Seadragonsearch Analytics Documentation Page
This is my template that I have created while I was working for a cool workplaces namely [Lotterywest](https://www.lotterywest.wa.gov.au/) and [UWA System Health Lab](http://systemhealthlab.com/). This is a template that contains extensions that are very nice to have when you just want a standard documentation for anything!

## What inspired this project?


Just erase those markdown files in the `/docs` file, and you can get started.

## Installation
Install this preferably in your global environment because this is just a code generator and so.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the project

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server. Very helpful when you want to take a look at the docs before deploying.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
* `mkdocs gh-deploy` - Deploy in github pages

## Project layout
```
    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
```
